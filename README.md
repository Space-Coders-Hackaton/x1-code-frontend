# Frontend Setup

This is a template for front-end projects created by Space Coders developers. You may
clone it and start a new project from scratch with all the style guides and settings we
use in every project. Remember, it all starts with organization!


## Usage

To use this template, first you will clone this repository using `http` or `ssh` links.
You can also set the new folder name to be your project name.

```
git clone <repository link> <new project name>
```

Go to the created folder and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

```
// You can use npm

npm install

// Or you can use yarn

yarn
```

Open the folder on your code editor and start coding!
